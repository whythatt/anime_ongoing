Don't expect to see things like violence, swearing, kung-fu action or magical girls. The plots are more like \"Today, Sazae-san goes to the new mall and gets lost\". Such \"boring\" plotlines and the simplistic art are often a turn-off to non-Japanese audiences, but most Japanese find the show incredibly good.

Murakami had wanted the film to be based on the life's work of historian Shigeaki Mori, who has spent more than 40 years gathering details on the 12 U.S. bomber crew members and prisoners of war who were killed during the atomic bombing of Hiroshima in 1945."
